**Starting Debugging**:

Open the "Run and Debug" view (usually in the Activity Bar).
Select the appropriate configuration from the dropdown (based on your launch.json file).
Click the "Start Debugging" button (play icon) or use the keyboard shortcut (F5).
Key Debugging Features:

Breakpoints: Pause execution at specific lines.
Step Over: Execute one line of code at a time.
Step Into: Step into function calls for detailed inspection.
Step Out: Step out of a function call, returning to the caller.
Variables: Inspect the values of variables during execution.
Call Stack: View the call stack to see the function call hierarchy.
